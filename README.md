## 📅 Day 3 — Introduction to C# & .NET Framework

> **Date:** 18/12/2025  
> **Topic:** C#, .NET Framework & Programming Fundamentals

---

### 🧩 What I Learned

- 💠 **Introduction to C#:**  
  Learned the basics of the C# programming language, its syntax, features, and its role in building modern applications.

- 🧱 **.NET Framework:**  
  Understood what the .NET Framework is, its components such as CLR (Common Language Runtime), and how it supports application development.

- 🔄 **Comparison of C# with Other Languages:**  
  Compared C# with other programming languages in terms of performance, ease of use, platform support, and application areas.

- ⚙️ **Compiler and Interpreter:**  
  Learned the difference between compiler-based and interpreter-based languages and how C# follows a compilation process.

- 🧬 **IL and MSIL:**  
  Understood Intermediate Language (IL) and Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and how C# code is converted into IL before execution by the CLR.

- 🧠 **Basic Problems Using C#:**  
  Solved simple C# programs to practice syntax, logic building, and understand program execution flow.

---

### 📝 Task for the Day

- Write and execute basic C# programs  
- Understand the C# compilation process  
- Practice simple logical problems using C#

---

## 📅 Day 4 — C# Architecture, Data Types & Operators

> **Date:** 19/12/2025  
> **Topic:** C# Architecture, Static Keyword, Data Types & Operators

---

### 🧩 What I Learned

- 🏗️ **Architecture of C#:**  
  Studied the overall architecture of C#, including how source code is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL), executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR), and managed within the .NET framework environment.

- 🔒 **Static Keyword in C#:**  
  Learned the purpose of the `static` keyword, how static members belong to the class rather than objects, and where static variables, methods, and blocks are commonly used.

- 🧮 **Data Types in C#:**  
  Explored different types of data types with a deeper focus on **primitive data types** such as `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`. Also learned how **type casting** works, including implicit and explicit casting, with practical code implementation.

- ➗ **Operators in C#:**  
  Learned various operators in C# such as arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and unary operators, and implemented programs to understand their behavior.

---

### 📝 Task for the Day

- Practice programs using primitive data types  
- Implement implicit and explicit type casting  
- Write programs demonstrating different operators in C#
