## 📅 Day 5 — Access Modifiers in C#

> **Date:** 20/12/2025  
> **Topic:**  Programming Elements & Access Modifiers

---

### 🧩 What I Learned

- 🧠 **Memory Management in C#:**  
  Learned how memory is managed in C#, including stack and heap memory, object allocation, and the role of the Garbage Collector (GC) in automatic memory management. Understood how C# efficiently handles memory without manual deallocation.

- 🧩 **Programming Elements (Level 1 & Level 2):**  
  Completed Level 1 and Level 2 programming elements, which included working with variables, data types, operators and basic logical problems to strengthen core programming concepts.

- 🔐 **Access Modifiers in C#:**  
  Studied different access modifiers and their scope of accessibility within a program:
  - `public` – accessible from anywhere
  - `private` – accessible only within the same class
  - `protected` – accessible within the class and derived classes
  - `internal` – accessible within the same assembly
  - `protected internal` – accessible within the same assembly or derived classes
  - `private protected` – accessible within the same class or derived classes in the same assembly
